  <h1>Get Ready for the Future &mdash; ES6 &amp; ES2015: CODING CHALLENGE 4</h1>

  <p>
    Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
    <ol>
      <li>Parks</li>
      <li>Streets</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.</p>

    <p>At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Tree density of each park in the town (formula: number of trees/park area)</li>
        <li>Average age of each town's park (formula: sum of all ages/number of parks)</li>
        <li>The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
        <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
        <li>Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/hyge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All the report data should be printed to the console.
      <br>
      HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameteres, maps, arrow functions, destrucutring, etc.
    </p>
