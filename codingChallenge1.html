  <h1>JavaScript Basics: CODING CHALLENGE 1</h1>

  <p>
    John and a friend invented a simple game where the player with the highest value of his height (in centimeters) plus five times his age wins (what a silly game).
    <ol>
      <li>Create variable for the heights and ages of two friends and assign them some values.</li>
      <li>Calculate their scores.</li>
      <li>Decide who wins and print the winner to the console. Include the score in the string that you output to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw (both players with the same score).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>EXTRA: Add a third player and now decide who wins. Hint: you will need the &amp;&amp; operator to take the decision.</p>
  </p>
