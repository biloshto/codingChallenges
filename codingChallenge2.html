  <h1>JavaScript Basics: CODING CHALLENGE 2</h1>

  <p>
    John and a friend invented a simple game where the player with the highest value of his height (in centimeters) plus five times his age wins (what a silly game).
    <ol>
      <li>Create an array with some years where persons where born.</li>
      <li>Create an empty array (just []).</li>
      <li>Use a loop to fill the array with the ages of the persons.</li>
      <li>Use another loop to log into the console whether each person is of full age (18 or older), as well as their age.</li>
      <li>Finally, create a function called printFullAge which receives the vector of years as an argument, executes the steps 2., 3., and 4., and returns a vector of true/false boolean values: true if the person is of full age (>= 18 years) and false if not (&lt; 18 years).</li>
      <li>Call the function with two different vectors and store the results in two variables: full_1 and full_2.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example input: [1965, 2008, 1992]
      <br>
      Example output: [true, false, true]</p>
    <p>Hint: You can use a loop not only to read from an array, like y[i], but also to set values in an array, like y[i] = ... You can also use the specific array methods.</p>
